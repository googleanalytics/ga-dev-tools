        is a Chrome Extension that helps you validate the measurement code on
        your website and troubleshoot common problems. It's an ideal tool for
        debugging and testing your analytics.js implementations locally and
        ensuring everything is correct before deploying your code to production.

      <Typography variant="body1">
        Tag Assistant works by letting you record a typical user flow. It keeps
        track of all the hits you send, checks them for any problems, and gives
        you a full report of the interactions. If it detects any issues or
        potential improvements, it will let you know.

        To see how Tag Assistant works, check out the video below. In it Philip
        Walton, Developer Programs Engineer on the Google Analytics team,
        demonstrates how you can use Tag Assistant to catch errors and check the
        validity of advanced measurement implementations such as{" "}
